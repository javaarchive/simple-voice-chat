## Important Notes

You need to open a port on the server.
This is port `24454/udp` by default.
Without opening this port, the voice chat will not work.
This port can be changed in the server config.
More information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki?t=setup).

This mod does only work when connected to a dedicated server.
You need to have this mod installed on the server and the client for it to work.

The Fabric version of this mod allows you to join with vanilla clients,
but you won't be able to use the voice chat features.

The voice chat is encrypted, but I don't guarantee the security of it.
Use at your own risk!
